    -   future1
    -   future2

## Blockers & Learning

1.  Time zones were a big issue trying to coordinate - if working as a group again, we must
    be more proactive and organised sooner.    

2.  Code becoming increasingly longer in CSS - in future, break down into separate files for easier bug-fixing etc.    

3.  Experience across the team was widely varied, especially with the use of GitHub and how to collaborate.
